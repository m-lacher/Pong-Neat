# Pong with NEAT AI
## Introduction
This python project uses the NEAT algorithm to train a neural net to play the classic game Pong.
I tried multiple apporaches to learn the capabilities of the NEAT algorithm.

## How to use
Currently, the script to train NEAT is [NeatWallTraining.py](/NeatWallTraining.py). It uses the [PongAgainstWall_multiple_players.py](/PongAgainstWall_multiple_players.py) to simultaneously run all NEAT genomes in the same "Pong Engine". 

To reproduce the training, just run the [NeatWallTraining.py](/NeatWallTraining.py) script.
